            <div id="contentarea">Here are some basic facts about me<br>
                <p> I was born on May 1990 in the Philippines and moved to the U.S. in the year 2000. 
                After living on the East Coast I moved to California in 2007 where I finished high school and continue to reside. 
                I completed my undergraduate courses at UC Davis as class of 2012 in Art Studio and then took classes in education at Sac State in preparation for teaching. 
                Currently I am taking courses in Web Development as part of a new career path I am taking after doing some work as a teacher for private and public schools. 
                My current job is with Amazon Fulfillment, which is the largest company I have worked for thus far.</p>
