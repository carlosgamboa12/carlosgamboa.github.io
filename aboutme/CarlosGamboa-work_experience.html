            <div id="contentarea">I have had the pleasure of working in various places in different fields<br>
                <p> Finding work during my high school and early college years was difficult because I was unsure about my career path. 
                It wasn't much easier after finishing my undergraduate studies since I picked a field of study that didn't bring much for employment. 
                I found small-time work while at Sac City and UC Davis helping students with disabilities and it would eventually give me footing for future jobs.</p>
                <p>A couple of years after graduating from UC Davis with my Art Studio degree, I started working with K-8 students at after-school programs and summer camps.
                The after-school program was a result of a partnership between the San Juan Unified School and the Parks District. 
                Then in 2015, not long after this job I began my Teaching Credential program at Sac State, where I would prepare myself for a career in teaching. 
                However, even after working in both private and public schools as a teacher and instructional assistant (IA), I didn't quite hold the career of teaching for long.</p>
                <p>In early 2018, after coming to an end of working in schools as a teacher and IA, I shifted my career to Web Development. 
                The reason for this was the coding work I did to teach kids at summer camps with a company called Intellibricks, based in Rockln CA. 
                From there I picked up the skills to work with programming through basic JavaScript and am now taking courses to prepare for a new career in Web Development.</p>
                <p>But as if that wasn't a big enough change, in the summer of 2018 I landed antry level associate job at Amazon Fulfillment in Sacramento. 
                This job, which is currently the biggest firm I have worked for, may have potential for growth in my ver-changing career path. Where I go from here is yet to be determined.</p>
                Below: Me at a table promoting Intellibricks, an after-school and summer camp that teaches kids robotics and JavaScript coding. In a way I began my path to Web Development through this job.
