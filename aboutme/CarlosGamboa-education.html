                <p>My entire life I have moved from place to place, and the same can be said about my education. 
                I started my school in La Salle Greenhills in the Philippines, then moved through various places in high school in both the East and West Coast of the U.S.</p>
                <p>Once I started college, I first went to Sac City and transferred to UC Davis to declare a major in Art Studio and Economics, an undergraduate program that I would complete in two years. 
                Though it was not the most lucrative of career paths, I followed my passion and made some work for presentation to theaters and festivals. But it was another field of study that would start me on actual work.</p>
                <p>About two and a half years after completing my undergraduate program, I had struggled to find an effective job until I started working with schools and students. It was then that I started my Teaching Credential at Sac State. 
                Ultimately though, I did not finish the credential program as my work with students exposed me to computer programming and code. 
                With this newfound experience and an entry-level job at Amazon Fulfillment, I started a course in Web Development thorugh UC Davis Extension. </p>
                Below: Me at a computer lab at St. John the Evangelist School. I taught computer class in the 2015-2016 schoolyear to K-8 students.<br>
