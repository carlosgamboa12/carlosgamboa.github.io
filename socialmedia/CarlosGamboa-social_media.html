            <div id="contentarea">You can find me on social media or view my online portfolio!<br>
                <p>Even before I started working on Web Development, I have been using the web for all kinds of things, among them social media sites like Facebook. 
                My Facebook profile has some personal information and posts, but is very safe for work as well so professionals can browse my profile without the issue of offensive  material appearing on the site.
                You can access my Facebook profile thorugh this link:
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/carlos.gamboa.9">Facebook</a><br /></p>
                <p>For a more comprehensive list of my professional experience, there is my LinkedIn porfile, which includes my education details and work experience compiled similar to a resume.
                I update my profile on LinkedIn each time I start a new job or class, or if there are any updates to my current education and employment.
                You can view my LinkedIn Profile from here:
                <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlos-gamboa-270b0671/">LinkedIn</a><br /></p>
                <p>Finally, if you want to see more of my art hobby that was briefly described on this site, you can head over to my portfolio on Wix. 
                On this portfolio are some of the things I have worked on through the years, from concept illustrations to comics and animations.
                Some of these were done for school, others for fun, but all show the kind of creative work I have done. 
                You can access the portfolio here:
