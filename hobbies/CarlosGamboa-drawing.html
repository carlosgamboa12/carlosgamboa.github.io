            <div id="contentarea">From my youth I have continued to take my passion for drawing forward, meeting new people and even making a little money out of it.<br>
                <p>After completing my undergraduate studies in Art and using my drawing experience as a base, I took what I had learned and applied it to certain unorthodox places.
                I learned to creat video animations during my time at Art Studio, and was able to create a piece that got screened in the local theater and won a couple of awards.
                It wasn't much, but my work finally got exposed to an audience and received some critical acclaim.</p>
                <p>In the years after my undergraduate studies, I started making comics for non-profit that I shared with other creators in a comic creators club, an event hosted by a local comics business.
                This also did not bring in any income to the table, but I got out there to spread my work with professionals who metored me to an extent. 
                Not long after that I began hosting my own art table at the local conventions in Sacramento, such as Sac Comic-Con and SacAnime. 
                These venues allowed me to sell copies of my work (for minimal pay that brought no actual profit) and be more exposed to public audiences.</p><br>
