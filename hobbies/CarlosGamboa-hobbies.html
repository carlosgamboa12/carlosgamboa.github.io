            <div id="contentarea">I Try to Enjoy Life in a Few Different Ways<br>
                <p>Since I was about 4 years old, my first activity to do as a hobby was drawing. 
                I would draw rather complex figures even while in grade school, mostly using cartoons as a reference before eventually doing live figure drawing in middle school.
                Throughout middle school and high school I drew comics based on superheroes and other action themes that interested me at the time.
                Little did I know then that I would pursue Art and Illustration so fervently as I did in my college years</p>
                <p>Another hobby that I enjoy is using the computer to do work and recreation. I've been using a com[uter since the days when WIndows 95 was first introduced and the internet was newly born.
                Whether I'm playing computer and video games (which is the more common activity) to writing text and code files, I found a hobby in working with computers that would eventually lead me to work with it in summer camps and to take Web Development as a course of study.</p>
                <p>My final hobby is less prominent than the other two, since I tend to spend time inside, but I also enjoy animals and nature when I go for walks outside. 
                Some of my favorite places to go are animal and nature centers where I can view exotic birds, reptiles, mammals and other kinds of animals. I would even get a kick out of going to the pet shop to see the exotic pets there. 
                Lucky for me, I live neare a nature center in Sacramento and occasionally walk there to do some hiking or animal watching.</p>
