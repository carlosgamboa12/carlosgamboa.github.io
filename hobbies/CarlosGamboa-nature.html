            <div id="contentarea">I do in fact have an outdoor hobby, though it's not as prominent as the others.<br>
                <p>My final hobby is more of a side activity that is not as actively pursued as the others. 
                I enjoy being around animals and nature, and often take the time to just observe things in the environment.</p>
                <p>When I was young I enjoyed watching the Discovery Channel and Animal Planet specifically for the nature shows. 
                As a kid I even had a dream of being a nature show host like those found on the channel programs. 
                But as an adult I have set aside those passions for a more subdued hobby of just getting into nature when I happen upon it.
                There are some events based on animals that catch my interest, like visiting a reptile convention or an aviary. 
                And even something as simple as the zoo I always get excited for, even though I don't often have the time to make such trips.</p>

                <p>Currently I live in Carmichael, CA and there are several areas that act as nature parks for me to visit. 
                Some of these areas are walking distance to my home, so I can occasionally get some exercise and observe the wildlife in the environment.
                Among the wildlife are deer, turkeys and even the occasional coyote (thought the latter is mostly found in the park areas).
                There are also many types of birds that visit our backyard, including Yellow-billed Magpies and Scrub Jays. 
                I always enjoy taking a moment to observe these natural fauna and phenomenon, as it brings a sense of peace to my often busy days spent working or indoors.</p>
